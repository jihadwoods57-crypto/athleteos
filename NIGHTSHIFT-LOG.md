# AthleteOS — Nightshift Build Log

Newest entries at the top. Each entry = what shipped + anything the founder needs.

## 2026-06-22

- **feat(history): real persisted daily score history feeding the Home trend.**
  Day-rollover now records the prior day's final accountability score
  (`computeDerived`) into a date-keyed, 14-day-capped `scoreHistory` log that
  survives the day reset. New pure helpers in `src/core/history.ts`
  (`appendDayScore`, `trendSeries`) and `dayRollover.ts` (`recordDayScore`);
  the store persists `scoreHistory` and records the prior day on merge. Home's
  trend chart now draws from real history (`trendSeries`), with the seed lead
  padding the left only while history is still filling. +11 tests.
- **fix(scoring): "this week" score delta from real history, not a magic 86.**
  The Home hero and Parent portal show "{delta} this week" beside a 7-day trend;
  the delta was `athleteScore - 86` (disconnected from the chart). It's now
  today's score minus the start of the same visible window, so the number and
  the trend slope always agree. +3 tests.

Verification each commit: `tsc --noEmit` clean, `jest` green (140 tests),
`expo export -p ios` bundles. Router intact (app/_layout.tsx + app/index.tsx,
no src/app).

### For the founder
- Real history only starts accumulating once the app survives a real calendar
  rollover on a device; until then the trend/delta fall back to the seeded lead
  (by design, so a fresh install still renders a believable trend). No action
  needed — just context for why early days still show seed-shaped trends.
- Next obvious history step (deferred — needs more data plumbing): feed the
  Parent/Coach trend charts (still hardcoded SVG paths) and a per-day **weight**
  history from the same persistence, replacing ParentView's static weight curve.
